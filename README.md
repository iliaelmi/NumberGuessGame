# 🧠 Number Guess Game

## 🎯 Description  
A simple and fun **Python number guessing game** where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.  
The program provides hints whether the guessed number is too high or too low until the player finds the correct number or decides to quit.  

This mini-project demonstrates the use of:
- Input validation  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Random number generation (`random.randint`)  
- Clean and modular Python coding practices
